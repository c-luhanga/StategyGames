# StrategyGames: An OOP Exploration with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to the StrategyGames repository, a creative blend of classic and innovative board games developed as part of an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) class. This project is a deep dive into applying OOP principles to build interactive games that challenge and entertain. With the help of GitHub Copilot, each game is crafted from the ground up, showcasing the synergy between traditional programming techniques and modern AI-assisted development.

The Games
TicTacToe
Rediscover this timeless classic through an OOP lens. Focusing on modularity and scalability, TicTacToe serves as a foundational exploration into game loops, player interactions, and determining win conditions.

BeeHive
Inspired by hexagonal grid gameplay, BeeHive elevates strategy with its complex game mechanics. Players aim to connect board edges amidst the intricate dynamics of bridge groups and cell adjacencies, offering a richer strategic experience.

Peg5
Peg5 introduces a novel challenge, blending traditional elements with unique rules. Tasked with forming specific patterns on a 7x7 board, players must strategically place pegs and tubes, testing their foresight and adaptability.

Core Principles
Each game is meticulously designed around core OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. The architecture is built for code reusability and maintainability, guided by interfaces and abstract classes. GitHub Copilot has been instrumental in refining the game logic and accelerating the development process, illustrating the potential of AI in programming.

Join the Journey
StrategyGames is more than just a collection of games; it's an educational journey into the heart of OOP, blending classic game design with the innovative use of AI tools.

Explore StrategyGames and embrace the challenge of strategic gameplay combined with the art of programming.
